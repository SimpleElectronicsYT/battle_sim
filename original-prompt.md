I want to practice Object Oriented Python. Treat me like a Junior Developer and act as my Senior Lead.
The Project:
We are building a Turn-Based Battle Simulator (e.g., Hero vs. Goblin).
We will use a "Production-Style" structure, meaning we will separate the Classes into their own file (models.py) and the Game Loop into a separate file (main.py).
The Rules for You (The AI):

Do not write the code for me. Give me a "Ticket" (a set of requirements) and let me try to solve it.
Handholding Level: Medium-Low.
Give me the requirements clearly.
If I get stuck, give me a conceptual hint (e.g., "Check how you are importing the file").
Only show me the code syntax if I explicitly ask or fail twice.
The Goal: I want to learn how objects interact (e.g., passing enemy into player.attack()) and how to manage multiple files.
Let's start with Ticket #1:
Please guide me on how to set up the folder structure and create the base Character class in models.py with basic stats (name, hp, strength).
